## Why did you build this? :thinking:

At the moment (2023) I'm studying at [Growdev](https://www.growdev.com.br/) in their fullstack web developer course and I'm currently in Object Orientation module (In this module we learn about Typescript, Programming
Object Oriented and its pillars). And, as the last challenge of this module, we were asked to create this!
