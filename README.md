# GrowTwitter (back-end)

</div>

## What is this? :thinking: 

GrowTwitter is a fictitious social network created by [Growdev](https://www.growdev.com.br/) with a style similar to Twitter. The purpose of this tool is to allow users to interact with others through various functionalities. In this project, the back-end of GrowTwitter was developed using the Typescript language and object-oriented programming principles. In this layer, users can be registered. Each user can create tweets, follow other users (using a followers mechanism), as well as like tweets from other users and/or reply to them with "reply" tweets.

## Why did you build this :question: :question: :question:

At the moment (2023) I'm studying at [Growdev](https://www.growdev.com.br/) in their fullstack web developer course and I'm currently in Object Orientation module (In this module we learn about Typescript, Programming
Object Oriented and its pillars). And, as the last challenge of this module, we were asked to create this!
